# When adding a file to a new generation run 2 additional threads:
#   - gzip the file
#   - diff the file to the previous (if there was one)
# then use smallest of raw, gzipped, diff and set kind accordingly

#	it doesn't exist)

#   --version|version
#

#	# diff the given gid1 of filename against one in current dir or
#	# against gid2 one if given
#   -e|--extract|extract <all [gid]|<gid> <filename>>
#	# extract all files at latest or given gid into the current dir
#	# if it is empty; or extract path/file.ext as path/file#gid.ext
#   -p|--print|print <gid> <filename>
#	# print the given generation's file to stdout
#   -l|--list|list [gid] # list gid x created x tag -or- all files for gid
