# CLI API
#   store <subcommand> ...
#
#   a|add [filename1|dirname1 [... filename|dirnameN]]
#	creates .dirname.str if it doesn't exist
#	creates a new generation adding all files in the current dir and
#	all given filenames and all files in the given dirs (if any
#	given), but excluding hidden files and excluded files:
#	Excludes are managed by the application itself not by the Store
#	database. When adding new files the application must exclude any
#	files/globs listed in .gitignore or .hginore files as well as
#	hidden files and sensible default ignores.
#   u|update [-v|--verbose] [any message text]
#	create new generation with message if given if no existing
#	.dirname1.str givens an error message saying to use add;
#	otherwise creates new generation with 'U' or 'Z' or 'S' for
#	every file present in the _last_ generation that hasn't been
#	deleted
#   e|extract <last|gid> [filename1 [filename2 [... filenameN]]]>
#	# extract all files at last or given gid into the current dir or
#	# the specified files using naming
#	# path/filename1.ext â†’ path/filename1#gid.ext etc
#   c|copy <last|gid> <folder>
#	# copy all files at last or given gid into the given folder
#   f|filenames <last|gid>
#	# print the latest or given generation's filenames to stdout
#   g|generations|generations [last|gid]
#	# lists all generations (gid x created x message)
#   p||purge <filename>
#	# delete the given filename in every generation
#   g|gui
