# Store

Stores snapshots of the files in the current folder (including/excluding any
supplied glob patterns). The user can view or diff any previous snapshot of
any stored file. If a store is done and the .str file copied and `store
extract all` is used, the most recent generation of files will be extracted
into the current directory (if it is empty).
